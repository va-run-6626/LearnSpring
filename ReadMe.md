# Learn Spring Boot

## Controller
- Here we Create the endpoint that we hit using any browser or API tool 
- it is the entry point of the system 
```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

// The @RestController annotation indicates that this class will handle web requests.
// It's a specialized version of @Controller that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, 
// allowing the methods to return data directly as HTTP responses (often in JSON format).

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    // The @GetMapping("/") annotation maps HTTP GET requests to the "/" URL path 
    // (i.e., the root path of the application) to this method.
    // When a GET request is made to this URL, the HelloWorld method is called.

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String HelloWorld() {
        // This method returns a simple string response: "First API".
        // The returned string will be sent as the response body of the GET request.
        return "First API";
    }
}

```
- this is the basics of what we are gonna learn 

## What are we gonna build ? 
![Architecture](./ReadmeImg/Arch.png)

### Three Layer Architecture
    - Three layer Architecture includes
        - Controller layer
        - Service layer
        - Repoistory layer

## What is Controller layer ?  
The **Controller layer** in software architecture is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests from the client, processing those requests, and sending responses back. In a typical **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, the controller acts as an intermediary between the **Model** (which contains the business logic and data) and the **View** (which is responsible for the presentation of data).

In the context of **Spring Boot**, the Controller layer:

1. **Handles Requests**: The controller listens for requests sent by the client (e.g., browser, mobile app) and maps them to specific methods. It typically uses annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, etc., to specify which URL patterns and HTTP methods it handles.

2. **Processes Requests**: The controller interacts with the **Service layer** (if present) or directly with the **Model** to process the request, fetch data, or execute business logic.

3. **Returns Responses**: After processing, the controller prepares a response (which could be JSON, XML, HTML, etc.) and sends it back to the client. In REST APIs, the response is often in JSON or XML format.

### Key Concepts:
- **@RestController**: Used in Spring Boot to indicate that the class is a REST controller, which means it will return data directly (like JSON or XML) instead of rendering a view (HTML).
- **Request Mapping**: Annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping` are used to define which URL paths and HTTP methods the controller will handle.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Client sends a request**: `GET /api/users/123`.
2. **Controller receives the request**: The controller method corresponding to the `/api/users/{id}` endpoint is invoked.
3. **Controller interacts with the service/model**: It calls the service to retrieve user data based on the user ID.
4. **Controller sends the response**: The retrieved user data is converted to a JSON response and sent back to the client.

The Controller layer's primary responsibility is managing the flow of data and requests, allowing for a clean separation between user interaction and business logic.

## What is Service layer ?
The **Service layer** in software architecture is responsible for implementing the business logic and handling operations that involve the core functionality of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the **Controller layer** (which handles incoming requests) and the **Data Access layer** (which interacts with the database or external data sources).

### Responsibilities of the Service Layer:
1. **Business Logic**: This layer contains the business rules and logic that govern how data should be processed. It ensures that the application behaves according to the business requirements.

2. **Data Transformation**: The service layer often transforms or processes data retrieved from the database or other external sources before passing it to the controller.

3. **Transaction Management**: In many applications, the service layer is responsible for handling transactions (like saving or updating data in the database). It ensures that multiple operations either complete successfully together or are rolled back in case of errors.

4. **Decoupling Business Logic from Presentation**: The service layer decouples the business logic from the web layer (controller) and data access layer, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.

5. **Communication with Other Services**: In more complex systems, the service layer might communicate with other services, microservices, or external APIs to perform specific tasks.

### Key Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: The controller focuses on handling HTTP requests and responses, while the service layer handles business rules, leading to a clear separation of concerns.
- **Reusability**: Business logic is centralized in the service layer, making it reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Testability**: The service layer can be easily tested in isolation from the rest of the system, allowing for better unit testing.

### Example:
Consider a banking application where you want to transfer money between accounts. The controller handles the HTTP request, but the service layer is where the core logic (like checking account balances, debiting one account, crediting another) is performed.

```java
@Service
public class AccountService {

    // Injecting a repository that interacts with the database
    @Autowired
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    // Business logic for transferring money between accounts
    public void transferMoney(long fromAccountId, long toAccountId, double amount) {
        // Fetch account details
        Account fromAccount = accountRepository.findById(fromAccountId);
        Account toAccount = accountRepository.findById(toAccountId);

        // Perform business logic: check if there is enough balance
        if (fromAccount.getBalance() < amount) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Not enough balance");
        }

        // Debit from one account and credit the other
        fromAccount.debit(amount);
        toAccount.credit(amount);

        // Save the updated account data
        accountRepository.save(fromAccount);
        accountRepository.save(toAccount);
    }
}
```

### Key Annotations in Spring Boot:
- **@Service**: Marks a class as a service, indicating that it contains business logic.
- **@Transactional**: Used to ensure that a group of operations within the service layer are treated as a single transaction (if one fails, all are rolled back).

In summary, the **Service layer** is crucial for maintaining the core business logic and ensuring a clean, maintainable, and testable code structure.

## What is Repository layer ?
The **Repository layer** (also known as the **Data Access Layer**) in software architecture is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data storage mechanism. It provides an abstraction over the data access logic, allowing the service layer to access data without directly dealing with database queries. In **Spring Data JPA**, the repository layer is commonly used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without writing any SQL queries.

### Responsibilities of the Repository Layer:
1. **Data Access Abstraction**: It provides a clean separation between business logic (service layer) and data access logic. The repository hides the underlying database interaction.

2. **CRUD Operations**: The repository layer typically provides methods to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

3. **Query Customization**: You can define custom queries using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL queries.

4. **Pagination and Sorting**: The repository can handle pagination and sorting of data directly.

### Example in Spring Boot:
In Spring, a repository interface extends `JpaRepository` (or other repository interfaces) to automatically provide data access methods without implementing them manually.

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Additional custom query methods can be defined here
    User findByUsername(String username); // Query method to find a user by username
}
```

- **`JpaRepository<T, ID>`** is a JPA-specific extension of the `Repository` interface in Spring Data. It includes methods like `findAll()`, `save()`, `deleteById()`, etc.

---

### **H2 Database**
**H2** is an open-source, lightweight, and fast in-memory database often used for development, testing, or small-scale applications. It can be embedded in Java applications, making it convenient for development environments where you need a quick database setup without configuring a full-fledged database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

#### Key Features of H2:
1. **In-memory Database**: Data is stored in memory, so it is lost when the application shuts down (unless you configure persistent storage).
2. **Easy Integration with Spring Boot**: H2 can be integrated with Spring Boot easily for prototyping and testing.
3. **Web Console**: H2 provides a web-based console where you can run SQL queries and inspect the database schema and data.

#### How to Use H2 in Spring Boot:
- Add H2 dependency in `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- Configure H2 in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

- Access H2 Console:
    - Go to `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` to access the H2 database's web console.

---

### **Java Persistence API (JPA)**
**Java Persistence API (JPA)** is a specification in Java that provides a way to manage relational data using object-relational mapping (ORM). It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and work with relational data using Java objects instead of writing SQL directly.

#### Key Concepts of JPA:
1. **Entity**: A Java class mapped to a database table. Each instance of the entity corresponds to a row in the table.
2. **EntityManager**: Used for managing database operations such as persisting (saving), removing (deleting), and querying entities.
3. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: It automatically handles the mapping between Java objects and database tables using annotations or XML.

#### Example of JPA Entity:
```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Annotations in JPA:
- **@Entity**: Marks the class as a JPA entity, meaning it will be mapped to a database table.
- **@Id**: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
- **@Table**: Specifies the table name if different from the class name.
- **@Column**: Specifies details for columns (optional).

---

### **Relationship Between Repository, H2, and JPA**
1. **JPA**: Defines the standard for working with relational data in Java, including how Java objects (entities) are mapped to database tables.

2. **H2**: Can be used as the underlying database for storing entities when working with JPA, especially in a development environment.

3. **Repository Layer**: Works with JPA to abstract the interaction with the database (H2, MySQL, etc.). The `JpaRepository` interface is often used in Spring applications to perform data access tasks without writing boilerplate code.

In a Spring Boot project, JPA handles the interaction between your entities and the database (like H2), while the repository layer provides methods to query and manipulate that data.

# Now we can Start with our code
## Step 1: 
  - Add Configurarions for **H2** and **JPA**
  - as mentioned in [How to Use H2 in Spring Boot](#how-to-use-h2-in-spring-boot)
```properties
    spring.h2.console.enabled=true
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:dcbapp
    spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=sa
    spring.datasource.password=password
    spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
## Step 2:
  - Create entity, service, repository, config and controller Packages
  - Add lombok dependency 
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
      <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
      <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
```
## Lombok
Lombok is a Java library that simplifies the development process by reducing boilerplate code. It provides a set of annotations that automatically generate common methods, such as getters, setters, constructors, and more, at compile time. This can significantly reduce the amount of code you have to write and maintain.

### Key Features and Annotations of Lombok

1. **`@Getter` and `@Setter`**:
    - **Purpose**: Automatically generates getter and setter methods for all fields in a class.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @Getter @Setter
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

2. **`@ToString`**:
    - **Purpose**: Automatically generates the `toString` method for the class, including specified fields.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @ToString
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

    - **Customizing**:
      ```java
      @ToString(onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)
      public class Person {
          @ToString.Include
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

3. **`@EqualsAndHashCode`**:
    - **Purpose**: Automatically generates `equals` and `hashCode` methods based on the fields of the class.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @EqualsAndHashCode
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

    - **Customizing**:
      ```java
      @EqualsAndHashCode(of = "name")
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

4. **`@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`**:
    - **Purpose**: Automatically generates constructors.
        - `@NoArgsConstructor`: Creates a no-argument constructor.
        - `@AllArgsConstructor`: Creates a constructor with all arguments.
        - `@RequiredArgsConstructor`: Creates a constructor with required arguments (final fields and fields marked with `@NonNull`).
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @NoArgsConstructor
      @AllArgsConstructor
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

5. **`@Data`**:
    - **Purpose**: Combines `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor` in a single annotation.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @Data
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

6. **`@Builder`**:
    - **Purpose**: Provides a builder pattern for constructing objects.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @Builder
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

    - **Example**:
      ```java
      Person person = Person.builder()
                            .name("John")
                            .age(30)
                            .build();
      ```

7. **`@Slf4j`, `@Log4j2`, etc.**:
    - **Purpose**: Provides logging capabilities by creating a logger instance.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @Slf4j
      public class MyService {
          public void performAction() {
              log.info("Action performed");
          }
      }
      ```

    - **Other Loggers**:
        - `@Log` for `java.util.logging`
        - `@Log4j` for Apache Log4j 1.x
        - `@Log4j2` for Apache Log4j 2.x
        - `@CommonsLog` for Apache Commons Logging

8. **`@Value`**:
    - **Purpose**: Creates an immutable class with final fields, and provides `@Getter`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, `@ToString`, and `@EqualsAndHashCode`.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      @Value
      public class Person {
          private String name;
          private int age;
      }
      ```

9. **`@NonNull`**:
    - **Purpose**: Ensures that a field is not null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is.
    - **Usage**:
      ```java
      public class Person {
          @NonNull
          private String name;
      }
      ```

### Benefits of Using Lombok

1. **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: Lombok helps in writing less code by generating common methods and boilerplate code.
2. **Improves Readability**: The code becomes cleaner and more readable as it focuses on business logic rather than repetitive code.
3. **Enhances Maintainability**: Less code means fewer places to update if the data structure changes.
4. **Standardization**: By using annotations, you maintain consistency across the codebase.

### How to Add Lombok to a Spring Boot Project

1. **Add Lombok Dependency**:

   **For Maven:**
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
       <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
       <version>1.18.24</version>
       <scope>provided</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

   **For Gradle:**
   ```groovy
   implementation 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.24'
   ```

2. **Enable Annotation Processing**:
    - In **IDEA IntelliJ**, enable annotation processing: `File` -> `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler` -> `Annotation Processors` -> `Enable annotation processing`.
    - In **Eclipse**, ensure annotation processing is enabled: `Project` -> `Properties` -> `Java Compiler` -> `Annotation Processing` -> `Enable annotation processing`.

Lombok is a powerful tool for reducing boilerplate code and enhancing the clarity and maintainability of Java applications. However, it's essential to use it judiciously and understand the code it generates to avoid potential issues during development and debugging.
  - Create a department entity in entity package
```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Builder;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long departmentId;
    private String departmentName;
    private String departmentAddress;
    private String departmentCode;
}

```
- Create a Deprtment Controller controller in controller package
### Important Interface + Class
Creating an **interface** for a **service** and **repository** in software development, especially in frameworks like Spring Boot, follows a **standard design approach** that promotes clean architecture, flexibility, and maintainability. This approach adheres to well-known principles of software design like **SOLID** principles and **Separation of Concerns**.

### **Key Reasons for Creating Interfaces Before Implementation:**

1. **Decoupling and Flexibility:**
  - By defining an interface, the service or repository logic is decoupled from its implementation. This means the client (which could be another class or layer) only depends on the **interface** and not the **implementation**, promoting **loose coupling**.
  - It allows you to switch the implementation easily. For example, if you need to replace your repository’s database implementation (e.g., from H2 to MySQL), you can just create a new implementation of the interface without modifying the code that uses the repository.

2. **Abstraction**:
  - The interface provides an **abstract contract** that defines what a service or repository is supposed to do without exposing the internal details of how it does it. This simplifies interactions between layers (e.g., service and controller layers) by hiding unnecessary details.

3. **Testability**:
  - Interfaces make **unit testing** and **mocking** much easier. For instance, if you're testing the service layer, you can mock the repository interface without worrying about the actual repository implementation.
  - Tools like **Mockito** allow you to create mocks of interfaces so that tests focus only on the logic of the method under test, not on external dependencies like databases.

4. **Interchangeable Implementations**:
  - You can have multiple implementations of the same interface. For example:
    - A `UserRepository` interface can have different implementations for **SQL** databases, **NoSQL** databases, or even **in-memory** databases.
    - A `NotificationService` interface could have multiple implementations like **EmailNotificationService**, **SMSNotificationService**, or **PushNotificationService**.
  - This is especially useful in projects where different environments or features require different implementations.

5. **Follows SOLID Principles**:
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: This principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. By creating smaller, specialized interfaces for each service or repository, you ensure that classes only depend on what they need.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules (like controllers) should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not on low-level modules (implementations). This makes it easier to maintain and extend the application as the high-level modules don’t need to be aware of the implementation details.

6. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**:
  - Defining an interface and then creating an implementation separates the contract (what the service/repository should do) from the logic (how it is done). This division helps in keeping the code clean and modular.

### Example Approach: Service and Repository Interface in Spring Boot

#### 1. **Repository Interface:**
```java
// Define the contract for repository
public interface UserRepository {
    User findUserById(Long id);
    void saveUser(User user);
}
```

#### 2. **Repository Implementation:**
```java
// Implementation of repository, could interact with a database
@Repository
public class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {

    @Autowired
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Override
    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return entityManager.find(User.class, id);
    }

    @Override
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        entityManager.persist(user);
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Service Interface:**
```java
// Define the service interface
public interface UserService {
    User getUserById(Long id);
    void createUser(User user);
}
```

#### 4. **Service Implementation:**
```java
// Implementation of service that interacts with the repository
@Service
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public User getUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findUserById(id);
    }

    @Override
    public void createUser(User user) {
        userRepository.saveUser(user);
    }
}
```

### **Advantages of This Approach:**
- **Modularity**: Each part of the codebase (controller, service, repository) only needs to know about the interfaces, not the concrete implementations.
- **Easier Refactoring**: Since the code depends on interfaces, you can change the implementation details (e.g., changing the database technology) without affecting other parts of the application.
- **Maintainability**: It’s easier to maintain and extend as business logic changes over time. Implementations can evolve independently as long as they adhere to the interface contract.
- **Scalability**: As applications grow in complexity, adding new implementations or altering existing behavior becomes simpler.

### Conclusion:
Creating an interface for a service or repository before implementing them is a **best practice** in object-oriented design that enhances the flexibility, testability, and maintainability of the codebase. By adhering to these principles, you create systems that are more adaptable to change, easier to test, and scalable for future growth.

## Step 3:
    - Create in service package
        - Interface -> IDepartmentService
        - Class for Implentation -> DepartmentServiceImpl
    - Create in repository package
        - Interface -> IDepartmentRepository
- We don't create a solid class for repo as the functions are directly given by JPA

# Save Department API
- **Note :** Find the explaination in the code itself (Comments) 
- first we create a DepartmentControllr controller to give an endpoint 
```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.controller;

import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department; // Importing the Department entity
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.service.IDepartmentService; // Importing the Department service interface
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; // For dependency injection
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping; // Mapping HTTP POST requests
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody; // For handling request body
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; // Marks this class as a REST controller

/**
 * This is the controller class for managing department-related operations.
 * It handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the service layer.
 */
@RestController
public class DepartmentController {

    // Service layer dependency to handle business logic for departments
    private IDepartmentService departmentService;

    /**
     * Constructor-based dependency injection of the department service.
     * This ensures that the controller has access to the service layer.
     *
     * @param departmentService The service interface for department-related operations.
     */
    @Autowired
    public DepartmentController(IDepartmentService departmentService) {
        this.departmentService = departmentService;
    }

    /**
     * HTTP POST endpoint to save a department.
     * This method accepts a department object from the request body and sends it to the service layer to be saved.
     *
     * @param department The department object received in the request body.
     * @return The saved department object.
     */
    @PostMapping("/department")
    public Department saveDepartment(@RequestBody Department department) {
        // Calling the service layer to save the department and returning the saved department
        return departmentService.saveDepartment(department);
    }
}

```
- From controller, we call in DepartmentService here we use the interface and solid class design [Important](#important-interface--class) 
- Now modify the following service package classes as the following code
  - IDepartmentService and DepartmentServiceImpl
  
```java
    package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.service;

    import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department; // Importing the Department entity
    
    /**
     * Interface for Department service operations.
     * Defines the contract for department-related business logic.
     */
    public interface IDepartmentService {

    /**
     * Method to save a department.
     * This method is implemented by the service class to handle department saving logic.
     *
     * @param department The department object to be saved.
     * @return The saved department object.
     */
    public Department saveDepartment(Department department);
}

```
```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.service;

import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department; // Importing the Department entity
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.repository.IDepartmentRepository; // Importing the Department repository interface
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; // For dependency injection
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; // Marks this class as a service

/**
 * Implementation of the IDepartmentService interface.
 * Provides the business logic for department-related operations.
 */
@Service
public class DepartmentServiceImpl implements IDepartmentService {

    // Repository dependency for interacting with the database
    private IDepartmentRepository departmentRepository;

    /**
     * Constructor-based dependency injection of the department repository.
     * This ensures that the service has access to the repository for data access.
     *
     * @param departmentRepository The repository interface for department-related data operations.
     */
    @Autowired
    public DepartmentServiceImpl(IDepartmentRepository departmentRepository) {
        this.departmentRepository = departmentRepository;
    }

    /**
     * Implements the saveDepartment method from IDepartmentService.
     * Uses the repository to save the department and return the saved entity.
     *
     * @param department The department object to be saved.
     * @return The saved department object.
     */
    @Override
    public Department saveDepartment(Department department) {
        // Delegates the saving operation to the repository
        return departmentRepository.save(department); // Uses JPA repository to persist the department
    }
}

```
- In the repository package modify the already created IDepartmentRepository as follows 
```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.repository;

import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department; // Importing the Department entity
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // Importing the JpaRepository interface from Spring Data JPA
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository; // Importing the Repository annotation

/**
 * Repository interface for Department entity.
 * Extends JpaRepository to provide CRUD operations for the Department entity.
 */
@Repository
public interface IDepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    // No additional methods are defined here. JpaRepository provides basic CRUD operations out-of-the-box.
}

```

# Hibernate Validations
Hibernate Validator is the reference implementation of the Bean Validation specification (JSR 380). In Spring Boot, Hibernate Validator is integrated to help validate JavaBeans (objects) based on constraints defined in the Java code. This ensures that data meets specific criteria before it is processed or persisted.

### Key Concepts

1. **Bean Validation Specification (JSR 380)**:
    - **Purpose**: Defines a standard way to validate JavaBeans using annotations.
    - **Annotations**: Provides built-in annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`, etc., for defining constraints on bean properties.

2. **Hibernate Validator**:
    - **Implementation**: Hibernate Validator is the default implementation of JSR 380. It provides additional constraints and features on top of the standard ones.
    - **Integration**: Spring Boot includes Hibernate Validator by default, so you don’t need to add it manually.

### Setting Up Hibernate Validator in Spring Boot

1. **Add Dependencies**:
    - Spring Boot automatically includes Hibernate Validator. If you are using Spring Boot Starter, it should already be included. If not, ensure you have the following dependency in your `pom.xml` (for Maven):

      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ```

    - For Gradle, include:

      ```groovy
      implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'
      ```

2. **Define Constraints**:
    - Use Bean Validation annotations on your model class to define constraints. For example:

      ```java
      import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
      import javax.validation.constraints.Size;
      import javax.validation.constraints.Min;
      import javax.validation.constraints.Max;
 
      public class Department {
          
          @NotNull
          private Long id;
 
          @Size(min = 2, max = 30)
          private String departmentName;
 
          @Min(1)
          @Max(100)
          private Integer departmentCode;
 
          // Getters and setters
      }
      ```

3. **Validation in Controllers**:
    - To enforce validation in a Spring Boot controller, use the `@Valid` annotation with a `@RequestBody` or `@ModelAttribute`. For example:

      ```java
      import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
      import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
      import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
      import javax.validation.Valid;
 
      @RestController
      public class DepartmentController {
          
          @PostMapping("/departments")
          public Department saveDepartment(@Valid @RequestBody Department department) {
              // Save the department
              return department;
          }
      }
      ```

    - If the data does not meet the constraints, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` will be thrown, and Spring Boot will handle it by returning a suitable response.

4. **Custom Constraints**:
    - You can also define custom validation constraints by creating your own annotations and validators.

      ```java
      import javax.validation.Constraint;
      import javax.validation.Payload;
      import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
      import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
      import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
      import java.lang.annotation.Target;
 
      @Target({ElementType.FIELD})
      @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
      @Constraint(validatedBy = CustomValidator.class)
      public @interface ValidCustom {
          String message() default "Invalid value";
          Class<?>[] groups() default {};
          Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
      }
      ```

      And the corresponding validator:

      ```java
      import javax.validation.ConstraintValidator;
      import javax.validation.ConstraintValidatorContext;
 
      public class CustomValidator implements ConstraintValidator<ValidCustom, String> {
          @Override
          public void initialize(ValidCustom constraintAnnotation) {}
 
          @Override
          public boolean isValid(String value, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
              // Custom validation logic
              return value != null && value.matches("^[A-Za-z]*$");
          }
      }
      ```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Provides a standardized way to validate objects.
- **Automatic Validation**: Automatically validates input data before it reaches the business logic layer.
- **Customizable**: Allows you to create custom validation logic to meet specific needs.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Spring Boot and Spring MVC.

Hibernate Validator in Spring Boot simplifies the process of validating objects and ensures that only valid data is processed, helping to maintain the integrity and quality of data in your application.

## We have added the validation in Department entity 
# Adding Loggers
Adding logging to a Spring Boot application is straightforward thanks to its built-in support for various logging frameworks. By default, Spring Boot uses `Logback`, but you can easily configure it to use other logging frameworks like `Log4j2` or `Java Util Logging`.

Here’s a guide on how to add and configure loggers in a Spring Boot application:

### 1. **Default Logging with Spring Boot**

Spring Boot uses `Logback` as the default logging framework. To use it, you don’t need to add any additional dependencies since it comes pre-configured.

### 2. **Add Logging Dependencies**

If you need to use a different logging framework, add the appropriate dependencies. For example, to use `Log4j2`, you need to exclude `Logback` and add `Log4j2` dependencies.

**For Log4j2 (Maven):**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**For Log4j2 (Gradle):**

```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-log4j2'
```

**Exclude Logback if using Log4j2 (Maven):**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logback</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

**Exclude Logback if using Log4j2 (Gradle):**

```groovy
implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter') {
    exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot', module: 'spring-boot-starter-logback'
}
```

### 3. **Configuring Loggers**

Spring Boot uses `application.properties` or `application.yml` for configuration. You can set logging levels, patterns, and other settings.

**Using `application.properties`:**

```properties
# Set logging level for a specific package
logging.level.com.example=DEBUG

# Set logging level for all packages
logging.level.root=INFO

# Configure logging pattern
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n

# Configure log file settings
logging.file.name=app.log
logging.file.path=/var/logs
```

**Using `application.yml`:**

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.example: DEBUG
    root: INFO
  pattern:
    console: "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n"
  file:
    name: app.log
    path: /var/logs
```

### 4. **Using Loggers in Code**

To use a logger in your Spring Boot application, you can use the `Logger` class from the logging framework.

**Example with SLF4J (which is used by Spring Boot’s default Logback):**

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyController.class);

    @GetMapping("/log")
    public String logExample() {
        logger.info("This is an info message");
        logger.warn("This is a warning message");
        logger.error("This is an error message");
        return "Logging example";
    }
}
```

### 5. **Custom Logback Configuration**

If you need custom configuration for `Logback`, you can add a `logback-spring.xml` or `logback.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.

**Example `logback-spring.xml`:**

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

### 6. **Log4j2 Configuration**

For `Log4j2`, create a `log4j2-spring.xml` or `log4j2.xml` in `src/main/resources`.

**Example `log4j2-spring.xml`:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="info">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

### Summary

- **Default**: Spring Boot uses `Logback` by default.
- **Custom Logging Framework**: Add the relevant dependencies and exclude the default ones if necessary.
- **Configuration**: Set logging levels and patterns in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
- **Code Usage**: Use `Logger` from SLF4J to log messages in your application.
- **Custom Configurations**: Use `logback-spring.xml` or `log4j2-spring.xml` for advanced configuration.

These steps should help you effectively add and configure logging in your Spring Boot application.
### We have implemented simple logging in the application this is for extra info 

## Exception handling in Spring Boot 
In Spring Boot, **exception handling** can be managed using a variety of approaches that allow you to control how exceptions are handled at different layers of an application. Proper exception handling makes your application robust and user-friendly by providing meaningful responses when something goes wrong.

### 1. **Global Exception Handling Using `@ControllerAdvice`**
The `@ControllerAdvice` annotation is used to handle exceptions globally, meaning it can catch exceptions thrown across the entire application, across different controllers.

#### Example:
```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    // Handle specific exception
    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<?> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(ex.getMessage(), request.getDescription(false));
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    // Handle global exception
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<?> handleGlobalException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(ex.getMessage(), request.getDescription(false));
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

Here:
- `@ControllerAdvice`: Marks the class as a global exception handler.
- `@ExceptionHandler`: Defines the method as the handler for specific exceptions. It returns a custom `ErrorDetails` object and HTTP status code.

### 2. **Custom Exception Classes**
Creating custom exception classes allows you to define exceptions that are specific to your application’s domain or logic.

#### Example of a Custom Exception:
```java
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

#### Error Details Class:
```java
public class ErrorDetails {
    private String message;
    private String details;

    public ErrorDetails(String message, String details) {
        this.message = message;
        this.details = details;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

### 3. **Exception Handling with `@ResponseStatus`**
You can annotate custom exception classes with `@ResponseStatus` to set a specific HTTP status when the exception is thrown.

#### Example:
```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```
- In this case, when the `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown, it will automatically return a `404 NOT FOUND` response.

### 4. **Handling Validation Errors (Method Argument Not Valid)**
When using validation (such as Hibernate Validator) in Spring Boot, you may need to handle validation errors.

#### Example:
```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.validation.FieldError;
import org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    // Handle validation errors
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    public Map<String, String> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>();
        ex.getBindingResult().getAllErrors().forEach((error) -> {
            String fieldName = ((FieldError) error).getField();
            String errorMessage = error.getDefaultMessage();
            errors.put(fieldName, errorMessage);
        });
        return errors;
    }
}
```
This will return a `400 Bad Request` when a validation error occurs, along with a map containing the field and error message.

### 5. **`@ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`**
Spring provides `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, which offers centralized exception handling across all `@RequestMapping` methods. You can override methods from this class for specific exceptions.

#### Example:
```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.ResponseEntityExceptionHandler;

@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomGlobalExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @Override
    protected ResponseEntity<Object> handleMethodArgumentNotValid(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex,
                                                                  HttpHeaders headers,
                                                                  HttpStatus status,
                                                                  WebRequest request) {
        Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>();
        ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().forEach(error -> 
            errors.put(error.getField(), error.getDefaultMessage()));
        
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errors, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```

### 6. **Using `@ExceptionHandler` in Controllers**
You can also handle exceptions locally within a specific controller using `@ExceptionHandler`.

#### Example:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/resource/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> getResource(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
        if (id == null) {
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Resource not found for ID: " + id);
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource found");
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<?> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(ex.getMessage(), "Resource not found");
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

### Best Practices for Exception Handling in Spring Boot
1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Create custom exceptions for specific error scenarios.
2. **Global Exception Handling**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` for consistent global exception handling.
3. **Custom Error Responses**: Define custom error response classes for meaningful error information.
4. **HTTP Status Codes**: Ensure appropriate status codes are returned for various exceptions.
5. **Logging**: Log exceptions and errors for better traceability and debugging.

By following these practices, you ensure a smooth user experience and provide meaningful feedback to users when exceptions occur in your Spring Boot application.

# Migrating from H2 in-memory DB to mySql DB
To configure MySQL in `application.properties` for a Spring Boot application, you need to provide details such as the database URL, username, password, and driver class. Below are the essential configurations:

### Example of `application.properties` for MySQL:
```properties
# Spring Datasource Properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Hibernate Properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

# Optional: Connection Pool Settings (for performance tuning)
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=20000
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=300000
spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=1800000
```

### Configuration Breakdown:
1. **`spring.datasource.url`**: This is the JDBC URL for your MySQL database. Replace `localhost:3306/your_database_name` with your database's host, port, and name. `useSSL=false` disables SSL, and `serverTimezone=UTC` ensures proper timezone handling.

2. **`spring.datasource.username`**: The username for connecting to your MySQL database.

3. **`spring.datasource.password`**: The password for the given username.

4. **`spring.datasource.driver-class-name`**: The JDBC driver class for MySQL (`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` is for MySQL Connector/J version 8.x).

5. **`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`**: This option controls how Hibernate handles database schema updates. The most common options are:
   - `update`: Updates the schema when necessary.
   - `create`: Creates the schema, dropping it first if it exists.
   - `create-drop`: Drops the schema when the session factory is closed.
   - `validate`: Validates the schema, making no changes.

6. **`spring.jpa.show-sql=true`**: Enables logging of SQL statements executed by Hibernate.

7. **`spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect`**: Specifies the Hibernate dialect for MySQL (adjust this based on your MySQL version, for example `MySQL8Dialect` for MySQL 8.x).

### Optional HikariCP Configurations:
Spring Boot uses HikariCP as the default connection pool, and the settings for the pool can be configured with the `spring.datasource.hikari.*` properties:
- **`connection-timeout`**: Maximum time (in milliseconds) that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool.
- **`maximum-pool-size`**: Maximum number of connections in the pool.
- **`minimum-idle`**: Minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP maintains in the pool.
- **`idle-timeout`**: Time (in milliseconds) before an idle connection is removed from the pool.
- **`max-lifetime`**: Maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool.

### Ensure You Have the MySQL Connector:
To use MySQL in your Spring Boot project, you need to include the MySQL JDBC Driver dependency in your `pom.xml` for Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
   <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This setup allows your Spring Boot application to connect to and interact with a MySQL database.

### Now Go to mySql Workbench create a schema with the name you want, start application and you are done

## Unit testing using JUnit and Mokito
- They are added by Default
  JUnit and Mockito are widely used for unit testing in Spring Boot applications. When writing unit tests, it's useful to follow the **AAA** methodology: **Arrange**, **Act**, and **Assert**.

Here's how you can structure a unit test using JUnit and Mockito following the AAA methodology, along with explanations in comments.

### Example: Unit Test for `DepartmentServiceImpl` using JUnit and Mockito

```java
package com.LearnSpring.OneShot.service;

import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department;
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.repository.IDepartmentRepository;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach; // Import JUnit for setup methods
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; // Import JUnit for unit test annotations
import org.mockito.InjectMocks; // Import Mockito to inject mocks
import org.mockito.Mock; // Import Mockito for mocking objects
import org.mockito.Mockito; // Import Mockito to simulate behavior of dependencies
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations; // For initializing mocks

import java.util.Optional;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; // Import for assertions
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

class DepartmentServiceImplTest {

    // Mock the repository layer
    @Mock
    private IDepartmentRepository departmentRepository;

    // Inject mocks into the service we are testing
    @InjectMocks
    private DepartmentServiceImpl departmentService;

    private Department department;

    /**
     * Method to set up the initial environment before each test runs.
     */
    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        // Initialize mock objects
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);

        // Arrange: Set up the mock department object
        department = Department.builder()
                .departmentName("IT")
                .departmentAddress("Headquarters")
                .departmentCode("IT-01")
                .departmentId(1L)
                .build();
    }

    /**
     * Test the saveDepartment method in the service class.
     */
    @Test
    void testSaveDepartment() {
        // Arrange: Simulate the save method behavior
        when(departmentRepository.save(department)).thenReturn(department);

        // Act: Call the method to be tested
        Department savedDepartment = departmentService.saveDepartment(department);

        // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
        assertEquals(department, savedDepartment);
    }

    /**
     * Test the findDepartmentById method.
     */
    @Test
    void testFindDepartmentById() {
        // Arrange: Mock the repository's behavior for finding by ID
        when(departmentRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(department));

        // Act: Call the method to fetch the department by ID
        Department foundDepartment = departmentService.findDepartmentById(1L);

        // Assert: Check if the returned department matches the expected result
        assertEquals(department.getDepartmentName(), foundDepartment.getDepartmentName());
    }

    /**
     * Test the deleteDepartmentById method.
     */
    @Test
    void testDeleteDepartmentById() {
        // Act: Call the delete method
        departmentService.deleteDepartmentById(1L);

        // Assert: Verify that the deleteById method was called exactly once with the right ID
        verify(departmentRepository, times(1)).deleteById(1L);
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Test Code:

1. **Arrange**:
   - We set up the necessary objects and mock behaviors using Mockito. In `setUp()`, we create a mock instance of `IDepartmentRepository` and a sample `Department` object to use in the tests.
   - In the individual test cases, we use Mockito's `when()` method to specify the behavior of the repository, like returning a department when calling `findById()`.

2. **Act**:
   - We call the actual method we are testing, like `saveDepartment()`, `findDepartmentById()`, or `deleteDepartmentById()`.

3. **Assert**:
   - After calling the method, we verify if the results match our expectations. We use `assertEquals()` to compare the expected and actual results, and `verify()` to ensure that repository methods are being called the expected number of times.

### Key Components:
- **`@Mock`**: We use this to mock the `IDepartmentRepository` so that we can simulate its behavior without relying on the actual database.

- **`@InjectMocks`**: This allows us to inject the mocked `IDepartmentRepository` into `DepartmentServiceImpl`, so we are testing the service layer without the real repository.

- **`MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`**: This initializes the mocks before each test method runs.

- **`when(...).thenReturn(...)`**: This is used to mock the behavior of a repository method call. For example, when `findById()` is called, it returns the mocked department.

- **`verify()`**: This is used to verify that specific repository methods were called the expected number of times, which is useful for ensuring side effects like deletion.

### Sample Maven Dependency for JUnit and Mockito:
Ensure that JUnit and Mockito are added to your `pom.xml` for Maven, though they are usually added by default in Spring Boot.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- JUnit 5 (Jupiter) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Mockito for mocking dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
        <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Mockito JUnit 5 integration -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
        <artifactId>mockito-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Conclusion:
By following the **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)** methodology, your tests will be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. This approach ensures that you're setting up the necessary data (Arrange), executing the method under test (Act), and verifying the results (Assert) in a consistent manner.

## Testing Repository layer in Spring boot 
Testing the **repository layer** in Spring Boot involves validating the data access layer of your application. In Spring Boot, the repository layer typically interacts with a database using JPA (Java Persistence API) repositories, often implemented with Spring Data JPA. Testing this layer ensures that your queries and persistence operations (such as saving, deleting, and retrieving entities) work as expected.

### Types of Tests for the Repository Layer

1. **Unit Testing**: This tests the repository layer in isolation, usually using mocking frameworks like Mockito to avoid hitting a real database.

2. **Integration Testing**: This involves running the tests with an actual database (commonly an in-memory database like H2) to verify the repository behavior in a real-world scenario.

Let’s dive into both types.

---

## 1. Unit Testing the Repository Layer

Unit tests focus on testing repository methods independently without requiring an actual database. Mockito is commonly used for mocking the behavior of dependencies like the repository.

### Example: Unit Testing a Repository Using Mockito

```java
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department;
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.repository.IDepartmentRepository;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

class DepartmentRepositoryTest {

    @Mock
    private IDepartmentRepository departmentRepository; // Mocking the repository

    private Department department;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this); // Initialize mocks

        // Creating a dummy department object
        department = Department.builder()
                .departmentId(1L)
                .departmentName("HR")
                .departmentCode("HR-01")
                .departmentAddress("New York")
                .build();

        // Mocking the save method of the repository
        when(departmentRepository.save(any(Department.class))).thenReturn(department);
    }

    @Test
    void testSaveDepartment() {
        Department savedDepartment = departmentRepository.save(department); // Simulating saving to the repository
        assertEquals(department.getDepartmentName(), savedDepartment.getDepartmentName()); // Assertion to verify the saved data
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Mockito** is used to mock the `IDepartmentRepository` so that it behaves as though it's interacting with a real database, but without actually doing so.
- We create a sample `Department` object in `setUp()`.
- In the `testSaveDepartment()` method, we call the `save()` method on the mocked repository and assert that the saved department matches the expected one.

---

## 2. Integration Testing the Repository Layer

Integration tests require an actual database to ensure the repository methods behave correctly. Spring Boot provides support for **in-memory databases** like H2, which are useful for testing because they reset after each test.

### Configuring the Test with H2

Spring Boot automatically configures an H2 in-memory database for your tests if you include the H2 dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Example: Integration Testing with H2

```java
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.entity.Department;
import com.LearnSpring.OneShot.repository.IDepartmentRepository;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest;

import java.util.Optional;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@DataJpaTest // Enables JPA tests with an embedded database like H2
class DepartmentRepositoryIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private IDepartmentRepository departmentRepository; // Inject the repository to test

    private Department department;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        // Create a sample department to test repository operations
        department = Department.builder()
                .departmentName("Finance")
                .departmentCode("FIN-02")
                .departmentAddress("Los Angeles")
                .build();
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Test Saving Department")
    public void testSaveDepartment() {
        // Saving a department entity
        Department savedDepartment = departmentRepository.save(department);
        
        // Assertion to ensure the department was saved correctly
        assertEquals(department.getDepartmentName(), savedDepartment.getDepartmentName());
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Test Finding Department by ID")
    public void testFindById() {
        // Saving a department and then retrieving it by its ID
        Department savedDepartment = departmentRepository.save(department);
        Optional<Department> retrievedDepartment = departmentRepository.findById(savedDepartment.getDepartmentId());

        // Assertion to check if department was retrieved successfully
        assertTrue(retrievedDepartment.isPresent());
        assertEquals(department.getDepartmentName(), retrievedDepartment.get().getDepartmentName());
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **@DataJpaTest**: This annotation is crucial for testing JPA repositories. It enables an in-memory H2 database and provides repository testing features.
- The test database (H2) is automatically set up, and you can use `departmentRepository` as you would with a real database.
- The tests, such as `testSaveDepartment()` and `testFindById()`, perform operations like saving and retrieving data, and then assert their correctness.

---

### Important Annotations in Repository Testing:

- **@DataJpaTest**: Used for testing JPA repositories. It configures an embedded H2 database and disables the full Spring context, keeping the focus on repository testing.
- **@MockBean**: Used to mock beans like repositories during testing.
- **@Autowired**: Injects the beans you are testing, like your repository or service.
- **@BeforeEach**: Prepares data before each test case is executed.
- **@Test**: Marks a method as a test case in JUnit.
- **@DisplayName**: Allows you to give a human-readable name to the test method.

---

### Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) in Testing

This is a standard methodology for structuring unit tests:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the test by preparing data or mocking dependencies.
2. **Act**: Perform the action you want to test.
3. **Assert**: Verify that the action produced the expected result.

For example:

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Test Finding Department by Name")
public void testFindByName() {
    // Arrange: Setting up the expected data
    String departmentName = "Finance";
    Department savedDepartment = departmentRepository.save(department);

    // Act: Retrieving department by name
    Department foundDepartment = departmentRepository.findByDepartmentName(departmentName);

    // Assert: Checking if the found department matches the expected one
    assertEquals(departmentName, foundDepartment.getDepartmentName());
}
```

### Conclusion

- **Unit testing** involves testing the repository in isolation using mocking frameworks like Mockito.
- **Integration testing** tests the repository's interaction with an actual database, often using in-memory databases like H2.
- Both types of tests are important for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your repository methods.



## Controller Testing

Controller testing ensures that your REST API endpoints are functioning correctly. This is typically done using the `MockMvc` framework, which allows you to simulate HTTP requests and responses. In your test class, you're using `WebMvcTest` to test the `DepartmentController` class. This approach helps isolate the controller layer and mock the service layer dependencies.

### Explanation of Comments:

- **Class-level Comment**: Provides an overview of what is being tested and the testing framework used.
- **Field-level Comments**: Explain the purpose of each injected field, including `MockMvc` and the mocked `IDepartmentService`.
- **Method-level Comments**: Describe what each method is testing, including the setup of test data and the expected behavior of the HTTP requests.
- **Inline Comments**: Offer explanations for specific lines of code, especially where mocking and request/response assertions are involved.

These comments will help clarify the purpose and functionality of each part of your test class, making it easier for others (or future you) to understand and maintain the tests.

## Adding configurations in applications.properties and using them in the development
adding configurations in `application.properties` and using them in development:

**What is `application.properties`?**

- A common configuration file used in various frameworks like Spring Boot for storing application-specific settings.
- Key-value pairs define these settings, making it easy to manage and modify them without changing code.

**Adding Configurations:**

1. **Location:**
   - Typically placed in the `src/main/resources` directory of your project structure.

2. **Syntax:**
   - Each line defines a configuration with a key (property name) and a value (the setting).
   - Keys are case-sensitive.
   - Values can be simple strings, numbers, booleans, or lists separated by commas.

   ```properties
   # Example properties
   server.port=8080  # Set server port
   app.name=My Awesome App  # Application name
   database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase  # Database connection URL
   feature.enabled=true  # Enable a feature
   api.endpoints=users,products  # List of API endpoints (comma-separated)
   ```

**Using Configurations in Development:**

1. **Accessing Properties:**
   - Frameworks like Spring Boot provide annotations like `@Value` to inject properties directly into your code.

   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class MyApplication {

       @Value("${server.port}")
       private int port;

       @Value("${app.name}")
       private String appName;

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Profiles:**
   - Create separate `application*.properties` files (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`) to define environment-specific configurations.
   - These files can override or extend the default `application.properties`.
   - Activate a profile during startup (e.g., with command line arguments or environment variables) to use its settings.

   ```
   # application-dev.properties
   server.port=8081  # Development server port

   # application-prod.properties
   database.url=jdbc:mysql://production.host:3306/mydatabase  # Production database
   ```

   - Run with a profile:
     ```bash
     # Using environment variable
     SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev java -jar my-app.jar

     # Using command line argument
     java -jar my-app.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
     ```

**Benefits of Using `application.properties`:**

- **Maintainability:** Keeps configurations separate from code, making changes easier.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various data types and environment-specific settings.
- **Centrality:** Provides a single source of truth for application settings.
- **Security:** Sensitive information can be stored externally (e.g., environment variables) and accessed securely.

By effectively using `application.properties`, you can improve the flexibility, maintainability, and security of your application configurations during development and across different environments.

### How YAML offers a more user-friendly approach to configuration management:

**Your Converted `application.yml`:**

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: root
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dcbapp
    password: varun
  application:
    name: OneShot
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
welcome:
  message: Welcome to App this is message from config!!
server:
  port: 8081
```

**Benefits of YAML over Properties:**

- **Improved Readability:** YAML uses indentation and nesting to represent hierarchy, making the structure clear and visually appealing compared to the key-value format of properties files.
- **Conciseness:** You can omit repeated prefixes like `spring.datasource` because YAML infers parent-child relationships.
- **Lists and Collections:** YAML allows defining lists and collections within properties using square brackets `[]` instead of commas in properties files.
- **Comments:** YAML supports comments denoted by `#` for adding explanations to your configurations, enhancing code understanding.

**Guidelines for Using YAML:**

- **Indentation:** Consistent indentation (usually 2 spaces) defines the hierarchy. Incorrect indentation can lead to errors.
- **Nesting:** Use proper indentation to create nested structures within your configuration.
- **Quotes:** Use single quotes (`'`) for simple values or strings containing special characters. Double quotes (`"`) are optional otherwise.
- **Lists:** Use square brackets `[]` to define lists of strings or values.
- **Booleans:** Represent booleans as `true` or `false`.
- **Comments:** Add comments using `#` at the beginning of a line. Multi-line comments are not supported.


**In summary:**

YAML provides a more intuitive and developer-friendly way to manage application configurations with its indentation-based structure, concise syntax, and comment support. By following the key guidelines, you can effectively leverage YAML for readable, maintainable, and well-documented configuration files in your Spring application.

## Spring-Boot Profiles

**What are Profiles?**

In Spring Boot, profiles are a mechanism for activating different configurations based on the environment in which your application is running. This allows you to tailor your application's behavior and settings for development, testing, quality assurance (QA), production, or other specific contexts.

**Benefits of Using Profiles:**

- **Isolation:** Profiles create separate environments for different stages of development and deployment. This prevents accidental changes or conflicts between configurations.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily switch between profiles to test or deploy your application in various environments without modifying the main configuration.
- **Maintainability:** Profiles help organize and manage configurations, making them easier to understand and update.
- **Customization:** You can customize your application's behavior and settings for each profile to match the requirements of the specific environment.

**How Profiles Work:**

1. **Configuration Files:** You create separate configuration files for each profile, typically named `application-<profile>.yml` or `application-<profile>.properties`.
2. **Profile Activation:** You activate a specific profile when starting your application. This can be done using command-line arguments, environment variables, or programmatically.
3. **Configuration Loading:** Spring Boot loads the configuration file corresponding to the active profile. If a setting is defined in both the default `application.yml` and the profile-specific file, the profile-specific value takes precedence.

**Example from Your Configuration:**

In your example, you have three profiles defined: `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`. Each profile has its own configuration settings, including the database URL, username, and password.

**Activating Profiles:**

- **Command-line argument:**
  ```bash
  java -jar your-app.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
  ```
- **Environment variable:**
  ```bash
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=qa java -jar your-app.jar
  ```
- **Programmatically:**
  ```java
  SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(YourApplication.class);
  app.setAdditionalProfiles("prod");
  app.run(args);
  ```

**Default Profile:**

If no profile is explicitly activated, Spring Boot uses the `default` profile by default. You can customize the default profile using the `spring.profiles.default` property in your `application.yml` file.

**Best Practices:**

- Use meaningful profile names that reflect their purpose (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `prod`).
- Keep profile-specific configurations concise and focused on environment-specific settings.
- Consider using profiles for features that are not yet ready for production or for testing different configurations.
- Document your profiles and their associated configurations for future reference.

By effectively using profiles, you can enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and manageability of your Spring Boot applications across different environments.

## Build + Deploy 
When you build and run a Spring Boot application with multiple profiles, several steps take place between running the `mvn clean install` command and executing the JAR file with the `--spring.profiles.active` argument. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### 1. **mvn clean install**
- **`clean`**: Deletes any previously compiled classes and resources in the `target/` directory, ensuring a fresh build.
- **`install`**: Builds the project and installs the resulting artifact (JAR or WAR) into the local Maven repository.

During the `mvn install` process:
- **Source Compilation**: Maven compiles the Java source files in the project based on the dependencies defined in the `pom.xml`.
- **Profile-specific Configuration**: Spring profiles (`application-{profile}.properties` or `.yaml`) are included in the JAR but not activated at this stage.
- **Testing**: If there are tests (e.g., using JUnit), they are run during this phase.
- **Packaging**: After successful compilation and testing, Maven packages the project into a JAR file that includes all dependencies using the Spring Boot Maven plugin.
- The result is a **fat JAR**, meaning all the necessary dependencies are bundled within the JAR file.

### 2. **java -jar <MyJarFile> --spring.profiles.active=<activeProfile>**

When you run this command, several things happen:

#### a. **JAR Execution**
- The **JVM** loads the JAR file and starts the Spring Boot application by calling the `main` method of the class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
- The `SpringApplication.run` method is invoked to launch the Spring context.

#### b. **Profile Activation**
- The `--spring.profiles.active=<activeProfile>` flag tells Spring Boot which profile to activate during the application's startup.
- **Spring Profiles**: Spring profiles allow the application to have different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, production, testing). These are typically defined in `application-{profile}.properties` or `application-{profile}.yaml` files.

Spring will:
- Load the default configuration from `application.properties` or `application.yaml`.
- Override or merge it with the configuration found in `application-{activeProfile}.properties` or `application-{activeProfile}.yaml`.

#### c. **Spring Boot Application Initialization**
- **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot starts scanning the classpath and applies auto-configuration based on available dependencies (e.g., a web server, database configuration).
- **Component Scanning**: It looks for `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations to create beans and wire them into the application.
- **Bean Creation and Dependency Injection**: Spring creates and injects beans based on the configuration defined in the active profile and auto-configuration.

#### d. **Profile-specific Bean Configuration**
- If there are any beans or components defined with `@Profile("<profileName>")`, only the beans matching the active profile are instantiated. Other profile-specific beans are ignored.
- For example:
  ```java
  @Profile("dev")
  @Bean
  public DataSource devDataSource() {
      return new HikariDataSource();
  }
  ```

#### e. **Environment Setup**
- Any profile-specific settings (e.g., `spring.datasource.url`, `server.port`, etc.) are applied.
- If you have environment-specific logging, database, or caching configurations, they will be used based on the active profile.

#### f. **Application Startup**
- The embedded server (like Tomcat or Jetty, if applicable) is started, and your application is ready to receive requests, with the configuration specific to the active profile.

### Recap of the process:
1. **mvn clean install**: Compiles, runs tests, packages the JAR.
2. **java -jar**: Starts the JAR with a specific active profile, loading profile-specific configurations.
3. **Spring Boot Initialization**: Initializes the application context, injects beans, and applies profile-based settings.
4. **Application is live**: The application runs with the specified active profile's configurations.

## Spring Boot actuator 
### **Spring Boot Actuator: A Comprehensive Guide**

#### **What is Spring Boot Actuator?**
Spring Boot Actuator is a powerful set of production-ready features that help you monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. It provides various useful endpoints that allow you to interact with your application and gather important information such as health status, metrics, environment properties, and more.

The main benefits of Spring Boot Actuator are:
- **Monitoring and Health Checks**: Provides metrics and health endpoints to monitor the state of the application.
- **Operational Management**: Allows you to manage and configure the application at runtime.
- **Easy Integration with Monitoring Systems**: Actuator endpoints can be integrated with monitoring systems such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK.

To use Spring Boot Actuator, you need to add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### **Step 2: Enabling Actuator Endpoints**

By default, most of the Actuator endpoints are disabled except for `/health` and `/info`. You can enable specific endpoints in your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.

```properties
# Enable all endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# Alternatively, enable specific endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
```

Once you configure this, Spring Boot will expose various endpoints such as:
- **/actuator/health**: Displays the health status of the application.
- **/actuator/info**: Provides application information (like version, build, etc.).
- **/actuator/metrics**: Exposes various metrics such as memory usage, CPU, and other performance indicators.

#### **Step 3: Common Actuator Endpoints**
Here are a few commonly used Actuator endpoints:

1. **/actuator/health**: Displays the health status of the application.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "status": "UP",
         "components": {
             "db": {
                 "status": "UP"
             },
             "diskSpace": {
                 "status": "UP"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

2. **/actuator/info**: Displays arbitrary application information defined in `application.properties` or `application.yaml`.
   - Example configuration:
     ```properties
     info.app.name=My Application
     info.app.version=1.0.0
     ```

3. **/actuator/metrics**: Displays various performance and resource utilization metrics.
   - Example metrics:
     ```json
     {
         "name": "jvm.memory.used",
         "measurements": [
             {
                 "statistic": "value",
                 "value": 12345678
             }
         ],
         "availableTags": []
     }
     ```

4. **/actuator/env**: Displays the environment properties used in the application.

5. **/actuator/loggers**: Displays and manages the logging levels of the application at runtime.

### **Creating a Custom Actuator Endpoint**

Sometimes the default Actuator endpoints may not fulfill your requirements. In such cases, you can create a custom Actuator endpoint.

#### **Step 1: Create a Custom Actuator**

To create a custom actuator, you need to use the `@Endpoint` annotation to mark your class as an endpoint and provide a method to expose the custom data.

#### Example: Custom `/actuator/feature-flags` Endpoint

1. **Step 1: Define a Custom Endpoint Class**
   - Create a class and annotate it with `@Endpoint`.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.Endpoint;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.ReadOperation;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Component
@Endpoint(id = "feature-flags")
public class FeatureFlagsEndpoint {

    private final Map<String, Boolean> featureFlags = new HashMap<>();

    public FeatureFlagsEndpoint() {
        // Sample feature flags
        featureFlags.put("featureA", true);
        featureFlags.put("featureB", false);
    }

    @ReadOperation
    public Map<String, Boolean> getFeatureFlags() {
        return featureFlags;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We define a custom actuator called `/actuator/feature-flags`.
- The `@ReadOperation` annotation defines that this method should be invoked when making a `GET` request to the custom endpoint.

2. **Step 2: Expose the Custom Endpoint**
   - Make sure you expose the new custom endpoint by configuring the `application.properties`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=feature-flags,health,info
```

#### **Step 2: Access the Custom Endpoint**
Once everything is set up, you can access the custom endpoint like this:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/feature-flags
```

Example response:
```json
{
    "featureA": true,
    "featureB": false
}
```

### **Types of Actuator Operations**

Spring Boot Actuator endpoints can support several types of operations:
- **@ReadOperation**: Exposes data (usually `GET` requests).
- **@WriteOperation**: Performs operations that modify the system state (usually `POST` or `PUT` requests).
- **@DeleteOperation**: Deletes something from the system (usually `DELETE` requests).

#### Example: Write Operation in a Custom Actuator

```java
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.Endpoint;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.ReadOperation;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.annotation.WriteOperation;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Component
@Endpoint(id = "feature-flags")
public class FeatureFlagsEndpoint {

    private final Map<String, Boolean> featureFlags = new HashMap<>();

    public FeatureFlagsEndpoint() {
        featureFlags.put("featureA", true);
        featureFlags.put("featureB", false);
    }

    @ReadOperation
    public Map<String, Boolean> getFeatureFlags() {
        return featureFlags;
    }

    @WriteOperation
    public void setFeatureFlag(String featureName, Boolean enabled) {
        featureFlags.put(featureName, enabled);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@WriteOperation` allows us to modify the state of feature flags. You can make a `POST` request to update the feature flag state.

### **Securing Actuator Endpoints**

By default, sensitive Actuator endpoints are only accessible locally, but you can secure them further:

1. **Configure Security in `application.properties`:**
```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.security.enabled=true
```

2. **Role-based access to Actuator endpoints using Spring Security:**
   If you're using Spring Security, you can restrict access to certain endpoints. For example, only allow users with the role `ADMIN` to access the `/actuator/shutdown` endpoint.

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to("health", "info")).permitAll() // public endpoints
        .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).hasRole("ADMIN") // restrict other endpoints
        .and()
        .httpBasic(); // basic auth for secured endpoints
}
```

### **Conclusion**

Spring Boot Actuator is a powerful tool for monitoring, managing, and interacting with Spring Boot applications. By enabling various built-in endpoints, you can gain insight into the application's health, metrics, and runtime behavior. Additionally, custom endpoints give you the flexibility to expose your own operational data.
